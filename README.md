# 36315 (Statistical Graphics and Visualization) Final Project

This was a group project I collaborated on with Max Liu and Uma Pradeepan for Carnegie Mellon's 36-315 (Statistical Graphics and Visualization) course during the Summer of 2021. 

We used the [Rio 2016 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rio2016/olympic-games) on Kaggle (also saved in the 'dataset' directory) to uncover interesting patterns with regards to how different physical and social qualities affect performances in the Olympics taking place in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Though this was a group effort, I focused particularly on the relationship between a country’s GDP per Capita and the number of medals won by its athletes. More specifically, I attempted to answer the following questions:

1) Which countries won the most medals, and of what types (including gold, silver, and bronze medals)?
2) Of countries that won at least one medal, what proportion of countries had a particular medal type as their most abundant winning? In other words, we counted how many countries had more gold medals than other medals, or silver medals than other medals, or bronze medals than other medals.
3) What is the distribution of and relationship between the total number of medals won by a country and the country’s GDP per capita? 

Max Liu and Uma Pradeepan devised and focused on the other questions and results presented. Together, we compiled the results into a Xaringen presentation (see the 'presentation' directory) and R Markdown report (see the 'report' directory).
